I have task list for you. Read it thoroughly and THINK about implementation of all steps. Follow plan step by step.

After each step:
- Lint code using `make lint`
- Update step item in this file, like `- [X]`
- Optionally you may add notes with prefix `Claude: {note content}`.

After all steps:
- In diff you just created remove all comments which are not related to business logic. Remove progress comments, change comments.
- Lint code using `make lint`. Iterate until fix lint errors.
- Run tests `make test`. Iterate until fix tests errors.

Tasks:

-- [ ] In `internal/model/settings.go:15` update `Settings` struct and add new fields

```
// NOTE: you may want to describe wanted structs, interfaces and etc

type Settings struct {
}
```
